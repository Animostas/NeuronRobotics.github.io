Github Gist is a code hosting website that makes coding social. A 'Gist' is a snipit of code, and we use it to host scripts for BowlerStudio.

BowlerStudio can load code from any Github Gist just by navagating to a website with a Gist embededded in it or by navagating to the gist page. To modify a demo, just click on the filename in the embeded gist to open the browser based editor.

If the Gist is not yours, hit fork.

Once you are looking at your own Gist, hit edit and edit the code in the browser. When your don, hit the update gist button. Your new code is read to run in BowlerStudio!
