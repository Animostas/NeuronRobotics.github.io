The DyIO is a Dynamic Input and output device. It has 24 channels and each one can be reconfigured into all sorts of modes. Each channel can be digital input, digital output and hobby servo. Select channels also have analog inputs, PWM generation, and many more options. 

Devices like the DyIO are passed to scripts using the name found on the connections tab. All currently connected devices are passed to each script. For more detailed DyIO scripting, head over to the 

[DyIO Scripting Tutorials](http://neuronrobotics.github.io/Java-Code-Library/Digital-Input-Example-Simple/).

If you had a DyIO connected when you started Bowler Studio you should have seen a connection dialouge box.
You can Check to see if the DyIO is connected by clicking on the 'My Devices' tab.

You may connect a DyIO now by plugging it in and selecting 'Add a new Bowler connection using Connection Dialouge' in the `Add Device>Bowler Device` menu
