Devices like the DyIO are passed to scripts using the name found on the connections tab. All currently connected devices are passed to each script. For more detailed DyIO scripting, head over to the 

[DyIO Scripting Tutorials](http://neuronrobotics.github.io/Java-Code-Library/Digital-Input-Example-Simple/).

This script will return an error if you don't have a DyIO Connected.

If you had a DyIO connected when you started Bowler Studio you should have seen a connection dialouge box.
You can Check to see if the DyIO is connected by clicking on the Connections tab.

You may connect a DyIO now by plugging it in and selecting 'Add a new Bowler connection using Connection Dialouge' in the `Connection>Bowler Device` menu
