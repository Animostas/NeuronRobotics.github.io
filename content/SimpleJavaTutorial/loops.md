##Let's Learn Loops!##
###The For Loop###
To begin learning for loops in Java let's start a simple project to help you see some applications for for loops. 
We will be looking at how a for loop can help us list all odd numbers between 1 - 1001. To do this we need to set an
integer, or i, to equal 1, and make sure the for loop stops looping when our condition, i equals 1001, is met, but not 
before, and to make sure that only the odd numbers are being recorded we need to increment i by 2 each time.

  for (int i = 1; i <= 1001; i += 2)
