##If/Else Statements##
###If Statements###
If statements check to see if a conditional statement is true or not, and if it does it executes the code within its
body. Lets look at a very quick example.

    int i = 1;
    if (i < 2)
    {
      System.out.println("This is an if statement that works");
    }
    int i = 4;
    if (i < 2)
    {
      System.out.println("This is an if statement that doesn't works");
    }

So now that you can see how an if statement works lets, why dont you try a quick quiz.

        inx x = 2**2;
        if(x > 4)
        {
            System.out.println("Does this work?");
        }
        int i = 9;
        if( x % 2 == 1)
        {
            System.out.println("Does this work?");
        }
