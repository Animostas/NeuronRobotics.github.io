##If/Else Statements##
###If Statements###
If statements check to see if a conditional statement is true or not, and if it does it executes the code within its
body. Lets look at a very quick example.

    int i = 1;
    if (i < 2)
    {
      System.out.println("This is an if statement that works");
    }

    int i = 4;
    if (i < 2)
    {
      System.out.println("This is an if statement that doesn't works");
    }
