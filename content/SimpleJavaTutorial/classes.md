Classes are what contains all your executable code in Java. We will make HelloWorld as a beginning example of how
classes work. Make a document and save it as `HelloWorld.java`.

The class name `HelloWorld` should match the name of the file (e.g. `HelloWorld.java`). For any program that you want to 
run, a `main` class is necessary. All `main` methods are written as seen above:

Sometimes there is a constructor statement, which is initialized in the main method. The constructor is a public method that
shares the name as the class.

Constructors are often used. But now you know the very basics of java and can start putting everything you have learned together.
