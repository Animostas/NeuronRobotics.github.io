Classes are what contains all your executeable code in Java. We will make HelloWorld as a beginning example of how 
classes work. Make a document and save it as `HelloWorld.java`.

    public class HelloWorld
    {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
      }
    }
