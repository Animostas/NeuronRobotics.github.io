#### Install Drivers before Plugging In DyIO ####

On a windows computer it is important to run the installer before plugging in the DyIO. This prevents windows from auto-installing a correct driver.

If you did this and are failing to connect to your DyIO then

1. Go into the `Device Manager`
2. Right Click on `DyIO v.3`
3. Select `Uninstall Driver`
4. Unplug the DyIO
5. Continue Below

First, Make sure you have the most recent version of java. Click on [This Link](https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp) to go to Oracle's Website and download the latest version of Java. If you already have Java installed you can skip this step. If you're not sure then click on [This Link](https://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1) to check your instalation.

Once Java is installed then download the Neuron Robotics Windows Installer by clicking [This Link](https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/java-bowler/releases/download/3.8.9/Windows-nrdk-3.8.9.exe) and open it.
